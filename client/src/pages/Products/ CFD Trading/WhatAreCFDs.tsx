              <h3 className="mt-5" style={{ color: "#198754" }}>What is CFD Trading and How Does it Work?</h3>
              <p className="fs-5">
                A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an agreement between a trader and a broker to exchange the difference in the value of a financial asset between the time the contract is opened and when it is closed. CFDs allow traders to profit from price movements without actually owning the asset.
              </p>
              <p className="fs-5">
                This means you can trade on both rising and falling markets — if you believe the price will rise, you go long; if you believe it will fall, you go short. The flexibility of CFDs makes them a popular choice for short-term traders and portfolio hedgers alike.
              </p>
              <p className="fs-5">
                With AvaTrade, you gain access to a wide range of markets and intuitive trading platforms to implement your strategies with precision.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mt-5" style={{ color: "#198754" }}>How Does CFD Trading Work?</h3>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Tradable Instruments</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">CFDs are available across multiple asset classes: shares, indices, commodities like gold and oil, major and exotic currency pairs, ETFs, and digital currencies like Bitcoin.</p>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Going Long vs Short</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">Going long means buying a CFD expecting the price to rise, while going short means selling a CFD to profit from a potential decline in the asset’s price. This bi-directional flexibility enables traders to navigate any market condition.</p>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>CFD Margin and Leverage</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">Leverage allows you to open larger positions with a fraction of the full trade value. For instance, 10:1 leverage lets you control a $10,000 position with just $1,000 in capital. Be mindful — while leverage can amplify profits, it can also increase losses.</p>
              <p className="fs-5">The initial deposit required is known as the margin. AvaTrade offers competitive margin rates and negative balance protection to ensure responsible trading.</p>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Trading Costs</h5>
              <ul className="fs-5">
                <li><strong>Spread:</strong> The difference between the bid and ask prices. This is the broker’s primary fee.</li>
                <li><strong>Overnight Fees:</strong> Also called swap fees — charged when positions are held past a certain time.</li>
                <li><strong>Inactivity Fees:</strong> AvaTrade charges a fee if your account is inactive over a long period.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Profit & Loss Calculation</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">Your profit or loss is determined by the number of CFD units multiplied by the difference between the opening and closing price. Remember to factor in spread and other trading costs for accurate calculations.</p>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Hedging</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">CFDs are often used as a hedging tool. For example, if you own physical shares, you can open a short CFD position on the same stock to protect against potential losses during market downturns.</p>

              <h5 className="mt-4" style={{ color: "#00BFA6" }}>Timeframes</h5>
              <p className="fs-5">CFDs are suited for day traders, swing traders, and long-term investors. Positions can be held from minutes to months — just be aware of rollover and overnight costs that may apply over time.</p>
