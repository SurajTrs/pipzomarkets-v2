        <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
          Navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading requires a well-defined strategy.
          A trading strategy serves as a systematic method for buying and selling that helps traders
          manage risk and make informed decisions. Here are some of the most commonly employed strategies:
        </p>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h4 className="fw-bold">üìà Trend Trading Strategy</h4>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            This strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the market when prices are trending.
            Traders aim to capitalise on cryptocurrencies experiencing a clear upward or downward movement.
            The goal is to buy during an uptrend and sell during a downtrend.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h4 className="fw-bold">üìä Range Trading Strategy</h4>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            Range trading is used when a cryptocurrency's price moves within clear support and resistance levels.
            Traders aim to buy near the support level (bottom) and sell near the resistance level (top).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h4 className="fw-bold">üöÄ Breakout Trading Strategy</h4>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            This strategy focuses on price movements after breaking key levels. 
            When price breaks above resistance or below support, traders enter in the direction of the breakout.
            However, caution is needed to avoid false breakouts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4">
          <h4 className="fw-bold">‚ö° Scalping Strategy</h4>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.05rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            Scalping is a high-frequency trading approach that targets small price changes throughout the day.
            Scalpers make dozens or hundreds of trades daily to build profits through quick, small gains.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mt-5">
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', lineHeight: '1.8' }}>
            Each strategy presents its own benefits and challenges. Choosing the right one depends on your
